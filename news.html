        <span>Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio is renowned for his work</span><br>
         as an environmentalist and activist for several global
          causes such as climate change.
        Now, with Chennai facing a water crisis, the Academy
         Award–winning star took to Instagram to alert his 32
          million followers on the issue.
        Leo shared a post from BBC News with the caption
         “Only rain can save Chennai from this situation.
        A well completely empty, and a city without water.
        The southern Indian city of Chennai is in crisis,
        after the four main water reservoirs ran completely
        dry. The acute water shortage has forced the city 
        to scramble for urgent solutions and residents
        have to stand in line for hours to get water
        from government tanks. As the water levels
        depleted, hotels and restaurants started 
        to shut down temporarily, and the air c
        was turned off in the city's metro. Officials in the city 
        continue to try and find alternative sources of
         water — but the community continues to pray for rain.”
        The photo by Getty Images is of a dried-up well
         in the city surrounded by women with empty pots peering inside.
        DiCaprio also commented on the post himself
         saying “We can change the world!”, adding 
         a positive note and hope that some action will be taken.
